# Authelia - Authentication and Authorisation Server

Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server and portal fulfilling the identity and access management (IAM) role of information security in providing multi-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. We will integrate it into the SWAG Nginx Reverse Proxy to manage remote secure access into your home media stack network.
