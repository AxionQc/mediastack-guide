**NOTE: This is PAGE 2 of** [**Ultimate Starter - Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, NZBGet, Torrents and \*ARR Media Stack**](https://www.synoforum.com/resources/ultimate-starter-page-1-jellyfin-jellyseerr-nzbget-torrents-and-arr-media-library-stack.184/)  
  
  
  
**PART 8 - Configuring the \*ARR Media Library Managers / Index Manager**  
  
Prowlarr \*ARR Indexer and Search Manager: [http://localhost:9696](http://localhost:9696/)  
  
Now that we have both the Download Clients set up on Page 1, we're going to set up Prowlarr, which is an index and search manager for all the ARR applications; it handles search requests on behalf of Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr etc.. to all the indexers, and returns the results to each ARR application that initiated the index search.  
  
1\. In "Indexers" -- "Add Indexer", to get started, add about eight indexers which are listed as public - these will mostly be Torrent indexers, as all NZB Indexers are private and you need an account to access the indexer services.  
  
2\. Make sure you select a Base URL and test the connection before saving. Some indexers have multiple URLs to choose from, and you may need to change the Base URL if any on them fail the connection test.  
  
3\. Once you have several indexers, select "Test All Indexers" to test their connectivity / status.  
  
4\. You can also test the "Search" function by typing "Big Buck Bunny" and checking that results are returned - Do not download anything yet, there is much more to set up before importing media.  
  
**NOTE:** If you're using Windows as your Docker host, you may need to open up network ports in the Windows 11 firewall, before you can access the web portals from the local network:  

*   

  
5\. "Settings" -- "Indexers" menu: Only used if you need index proxies  
  
6\. "Settings" -- "Apps" menu: Go to all the other ARR applications listed below, then navigate to "Settings" -- "General" and copy the API Key from each application. Then back in Prowlarr, click "Add Application", and use the API Key to link the other application to Prowlarr.  
  
**For example: To add Radarr**  

*   Name: Radarr
*   Sync Level: Full Sync
*   Prowlarr: Add "[http://localhost:9696](http://localhost:9696)" Check the field to see if the text is actually in there.
*   Reader: Add "[http://localhost:7878](http://localhost:7878)" Check the field to see if the text is actually in there.
*   API Key: Copied from Radarr application in "Settings" -- "General"
*   Test and Save

Repeat this step for all \*ARR applications until you have Lidarr, Mylar, Radarr, Readarr, Sonarr and Whisparr listed in the Prowlarr applications - There should be six.  
  
**NOTE For Mylar:** Go to "Settings" -- "Web Interface" -- Tick Enable API -- Generate API Key -- Save Changes -- Restart Mylar -- API Key can now be copied.

8\. Add the "Root Folder" for all of the \*ARR medial managers, so they are able to access / manage the media in each library.  
  
**NOTE: It is recommended you allow all of the Media Library Managers to totally manage your media, including the renaming and sorting of media into its own media folder structure and naming conventions. Select "Show Advanced" and follow the naming conventions in the table below, for the relevant media managers.  
  
NOTE: Do not add your own media into your media folders yet, we will prepare all of your existing media in steps further below, before importing into each of the media libraries, to ensure they're in a format that the \*ARR applications will each read be able to identify and match to Internet media lookup searches.**

*   Use Newznab: Ticked

  
**NOTE:** There is no need to manually update the Torrent / Usenet settings listed on this page, Prowlarr will  
automatically make the relevant changes to search providers as they're added to the \*ARR Index Manager.  
  
  
10\. Finish the basic customisation below for all of the \*ARR settings:

Test Each of Your \*APP Application:  

*   From the application home page, select "Add New", and search title for each application's media category.
*   You should get search results for each of the media types that each application is responsible for managing.

  
  
**NOTE: Whisparr - Adult Movie Industry Metadata**  
  
Whisparr will correctly locate metadata for adult movie industry content, however Jellyfin does not, for reasons we won't go into here. However, you can save the metadata for adult content from Whisparr into the movie folder on the hard drive, then Jellyfin can be set up to read and import the metadata correctly.  
  
Go to "Whisparr" -- "Settings" -- "Metadata" -- "Edit Kodi (XBMC) / Emby Metadata" and select all options, except for "Use Movie.nfo", and save. This will create .nfo and cover art files inside the movie folder, which Jellyfin will scrape during import of the adult library.  
  
**NOTE:** This technique can be used for other media types which do not work well in Jellyfin metadata look ups.  
  
  
NOTE: If you have following this guide step by step, you'll probably notice the theme used across most of the applications is, or is not to your likely, you can change the theme to something that suites you suit by editing the following variable in the .ENV file, and redeploying your media stack configuration discussed on Page 1.  
  

Code:

    TP_THEME=nord

  
Refer to colour these codes at: [Aquamarine - theme.park Docs](https://docs.theme-park.dev/theme-options/aquamarine/)  
  
  
  
  
**PART 9 - Organising Your Media Library And Importing Into \*ARR Apps**  
  
Now that we've set up the Media Library Managers and Index Manager with the correct settings, including filenames for all media content, we can commence importing any of your current media repositories into the respective Media Library Managers for each media format type.  
  
**NOTE: The success of importing media files into the media libraries and having them identified correctly by the library managers, depends heavily on the how well they are organised and named in the first place. Don't expect to load random files which have no naming conventions, or cannot identify what the content is, to be picked up and imported correctly. Do some effort first to save you importing time - otherwise: the old adage is… shit in, shit out.**  
  
My personal preference is to use Filebot with the following renaming conventions to get things organised, before I manually add anything into the \*ARR media folders.  
  
  
**Filebot Renaming Preset String for Series / TV Shows:**  
  
D:/Storage/renaming/series/{ny.colon(' - ').ascii()} \[tmdbid-{id}\]/Season {s00}/{ny.colon(' - ').ascii()} {s00e00} - {t.ascii()} {" - $hd $vf $vc $ac"}  
  
  
**Filebot Renaming Preset String for Movies / Adult:**  
  
D:/Storage/renaming/movies/{ny.colon(' - ').ascii()} \[imdbid-{imdbid}\]/{ny.colon(' - ').ascii()} {" - $hd $vf $vc $ac"}  
  
  
**Filebot Renaming Preset String for Music / Audio:**  
  
D:/Storage/renaming/music/{artist.upperInitial().ascii()}/{album.upperInitial().ascii()} ({y})/{albumArtist.upperInitial().ascii()} - {album.upperInitial().ascii()} - {pi.pad(3)+' - '} {t.ascii()}  
  
  
Change "D:/Storage" to suit your requirements. Being on the same drive / partition as the original media which is being renamed, will save considerable time moving files between partitions or across network shares. i.e. Don't use a different partition / HDD as the destination, it will take forever.  
  
**NOTE:** Do all media renaming outside of \*ARR folders, then slowly control the import of the renamed media into each of the Library Managers.  
  
Once you have prepared all of your current media folders, start importing a few series / movies at a time, to ensure the \*ARR Library Manager is detecting the new media, and that you're comfortable with the process.  
  
As you start adding files in the following folders, the files will be immediately accessible in each of the \*ARR apps  
  
  

Host Computer Folder Location:

\*ARR Library Manager

FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA/adult

Whisparr

FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA/books

Readarr

FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA/comics

Mylar3

FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA/movies

Radarr

FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA/music

Lidarr

FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA/series

Sonarr

  
  
Head over the your \*ARR application to "Settings" -- "Media Management"… you'll note that the root folder "/data/media/series" etc... inside each Docker container now says there are a number of "Unmapped Folders".  
  
To import the new media you copied into your FOLDER\_FOR\_MEDIA folders, open the link that says "Path: /data/media/series", it will now show the series / movies which you added, and will attempt to identify these new series / movies by looking them up via the Internet databases.  
  
NOTE: This could take some time depending on how large the media library is.  
  
NOTE: DO NOT IMPORT ANY MOVIE / SERIES WHICH ARE INCORRENTLY IDENTIFIED, RENAME THEM AND TRY TO IMPORT THEM AGAIN LATER  
  
Select all of the folders / media which has been correctly identified by using the checkboxes on the left hand side, then down the bottom select whether to monitor the first season, or the entire season (this is your personal choice), then select the option "Import \* Series" - This will commence the import and renaming if you opted to rename.  
  
For any movie / series which was incorrectly identified, go to your local media directory and rename the folder, and then import the new folder after the \*ARR manager correctly identifies the folder content.  
  
Once identified, select "Import \* Series". If successful, you will receive a message that says: All series in /data/media/imports have been imported.  
  
Use the same process in all of the other \*ARR applications to import your existing media library into the corresponding \*ARR Media Library Manager.  
  
NOTE:: If you do a lot of transcoding and changing the encoding types / bitrates across your library, the Filebot renaming strings can be used to update your media library as needed, however you'll need to refresh your \*ARR Media Library Managers / Jellyfin to make sure they pick up the new names.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

**WARNING - THE BELOW INFORMATION IS STILL BEING FORMATTED FOR PRESENTATION - IT SHOULD BE ACCURATE, BUT DIFFICULT TO READ. AM CURRENTLY FORMATTING NOW.**​

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**PART 10 - Configuring Jellyfin Media Server**  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
\#### Configuring Jellyfin to access all Media Libraries  
  
Firstly, head over and set up accounts at Fanart and Opensubtitles, so you can enrich your Jellyfin media content. Once you have accounts, you'll need to copy the API Key from each of your account profiles  
[https://fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv/)  
[https://opensubtitles.com](https://opensubtitles.com/) (opensubtitles.org and opensubtitles.com are the same, but .com is the newer site for accounts)  
  
  

*   Head over to Jellyfin at [http://localhost:8096](http://localhost:8096/) where you will be welcomed to Jellyfin, choose your desired language and select "Next".
*   Create a username / password for the first user account (it will become the admin account) - you can have a blank password if you desire - Select "Next".
*   DO NOT ADD MEDIA at this time, select "Next", as we want to set up Fanart and other plugins first.
*   Select your Metadata Language and Country and select "Next".
*   Set up remote access: Remote connections (Ticked), Enable port mapping (No / Unticked) - Select "Next", the "Finsh".
*   You'll be presented with a signin page, use the username / password entered previously.

  
Press the hamburger icon (3 lines) in top left corner to open the menu, then select "Dashboard", go down the bottom of the menu and open "Plugins", the select "Repositories" up the top, and add the following:  
  
Repository Name: Daniel Adov  
Repository URL: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieladov/JellyfinPluginManifest/master/manifest.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danieladov/JellyfinPluginManifest/master/manifest.json)  
  
Using the "Plugins" -- "Catalogue" menu, add the following plugins to your Jellyfin instance:  
  

*   AniDB
*   AniList
*   Fanart
*   Merge Versions
*   Open Subtitles
*   Playback Reporting
*   Reports
*   Skin Manager
*   TMDb Box Sets
*   Tvmaze
*   TheTVDB

  
These plugins should already be installed by default:  
  

*   AudioDB
*   MusicBrainz - Installed by default
*   OMDb - Installed by default
*   Studio Images
*   TMDb

  
Now that all of the plugins have been installed, go to Docker / Portainer, select the Jellyfin container and restart it. Then come back to Jellyfin config.  
  
Open the hamburger menu in top left corner again and then select "Dashboard", go down the bottom of the menu and open "Plugins", and configure the following plugins:  
  

*   AniDB - Defaults
*   AniList - Defaults
*   Fanart - Add "Personal API Key" from your Fanart.tv account, and save.
*   Merge Versions - Defaults
*   Open Subtitles - Add Username / Password / API Key from your OpenSubtitles.com account, and save.
*   Playback Reporting - Defaults
*   Reports - Defaults
*   Skin Manager - Select a skin of your choosing, however further customisation is outside the scope of this guide.
*   TMDb - Include adult content (Optional), Import season name (Ticked), Max Cast Members (25), Image Scaling (Optional), and save.
*   TMDb Box Sets - Defaults
*   Tvmaze - Nil
*   TheTVDB - If there is no API Key pre-installed, you will need to register at [https://TheTVDB.com](https://thetvdb.com/) to obtain one.

  
"Playback" -- "Transcoding"  
Depending on the computer / NAS you are running Docker / Jellyfin, its possible to use hardware acceleration for transcoding - this configuration has been set up to map /dev/dri from the docker container to the host, so it will work, but will be dependent upon your personal hardware configuration. You will need to seek further advise from the Jellyfin community at Reddit / Discord / Youtube on settings for your hardware.  
  
Refer: [Hardware Acceleration | Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/hardware-acceleration/)  
DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance): As this guide and configuration is built around a secure contained network for the entire media docker stack, the ports and services needed to support DLNA have not been mapped and exposed to the host network. The docker configuration can be customised to allow for DLNA, however it is outside the scope of this starter guide. So these settings won't work unless the docker-compose is reconfigured by yourself.  
  
"Libraries" -- "Display"  
Date added behavior for new content: change to "Use date scanned into library".

PART 11 - Configuring Jellyseerr  
  
  
[http://localhost:5055](http://localhost:5055) jellyseerr  
  
  
  
When you open Jellyseer for the first time, you'll be asked to sign in… select "Use your Jellyfin Account", and enter the details from your Jellyfin server in order to link it to Jellyseerr.  
  
Jellyfin URL: [http://localhost:8096](http://localhost:8096)  
Email Address: The email address is only used if you want to set up notifications when media has been downloaded, however it is a mandatory field.  
Username: Same username as Jellyfin  
Password: Same password as Jellyfin  
  
After connecting Jellyseerr to Jellyfin, you will need to synchronise the libraries between the two applications.  
  
Select "Sync Libraries", then use the slide toggle to select "Movies" and "Series", However…. DO NOT PRESS "START SCAN", skip the library scan and go straight to "Continue".  
  
**NOTE**: We skip the library scan on initial setup as it can take quite a while to scan the libraries, it is also dependant on Jellyfin having its libraries fully scanned and up to date, so it will be better to scan the libraries after all the configurations are completed.  
  
NOTE: Adult Content - Jellyseerr does not manage Adult content requests, so if you are using Whisparr, the library will appear in "Jellyfin Libraries", however there is no need to activate it for syncing. If the library exists in Jellyfin, it will be seen in Jellyseerr, you just don't need to enable it.

After adding the connectors to Radarr and Sonarr, Jellyseerr will be fully functional, however we want to do some additional configurations before importing users and media information from Jellyfin.  
  
Go to "Settings" -- "General" and make any changes to region and language as needed.  
  
  
Go to "Settings" -- "Users" and make any changes for users, you may want to change the default permissions assigned to new users.  
  
If you want to allow all users to automatically request, approve and download any media type and quality up to 1080P, then you would select "Request", "Auto-Approved", and "Auto-Request". You can select additional permissions and allow automated 4K requests, however the data will quickly add up on the server if is it not controlled, so grant this privilege with due care.  
  
NOTE: These privileges / permissions are applied when new accounts are created or imported from Jellyfin, they do not effect existing user accounts.  
  
  
Go to "Settings" -- "Jellyfin" and select "Start Scan" to commence scanning the Jellyfin libraries for all media.  
  
Go to "Settings" -- "Notifications", you can add any email server settings or integrations if you want to get notifications on the status of your media requests.  
  
Go to the "Users" menu, and you can now create local users, or "Import Jellyfin Users" (preferred). The new users will be granted the privileges / permissions which we set up earlier.
