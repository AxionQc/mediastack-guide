# Docker Environment File


## Heading One

!!! Danger "Warning: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Page Under Development"

    This page is still under development and may not have accurate information, and should be considered incomplete / inaccurate until this notice is removed.



Basic intro to Docker... embed Docker intro video etc..

Provide steps to install Docker on Windows, Linux, MacOS, Synology NAS and other hosts where possible


## Heading Two

## Heading Three


The docker applications are deployed and configured using an environment file, which ensures all variables and settings are shared consistantly across all of the applications as they are deployed.

The environment file is called `docker-compose.env`, and it is exactly the same file located in each of the folders

!!! note "File: docker-compose.env &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <-- Default Configuration File"

PART 3 - Configuring the Docker-Compose Environment Settings

This implementation will use a docker-compose configuration file and an accompanying environment file, containing all of the variables for the docker-compose file, so it can be customised to your individual requirements. This allows complex docker builds to be rapidly deployed over and over with relative ease, and minimal input. In fact, it is quicker and easier to delete all of the docker applications and redeploy it again, rather than trying to do any fault finding when errors occur. It is also a simply way to upgrade application versions, by deleting the entire docker stack, and redeploying again using updated images.

Download Docker Compose Media Stack - Yaml file
Download Docker Compose Media Stack - Environment file

Below are some of the planning details / settings you need to consider, which are located inside the Environment File - they should be updated to suit your needs.

Define Docker Stack and Local Network Details:

You can change the subnet / gateway of the network inside docker where these applications will be deployed, if you are not experienced with docker, then leave the subnet / gateway settings alone.

Put your internal home network details into the LOCAL_SUBNET variable, this will tell the VPN client to allow local computers on this network, they are allowed to access each of the applications inside the secure docker stack.

DOCKER_SUBNET=172.28.10.0/24
DOCKER_GATEWAY=172.28.10.1
LOCAL_SUBNET=192.168.1.0/24 <-- your local / home network subnet details here

Once the docker stack has been created and the VPN connection established, Gluetun also allows all computers on the local network, to piggy back off the VPN connection and send all web traffic from your local computer through the secure tunnel. You can change your web proxy to the IP address of your Docker host, using port 8888. A point to remember, if your Docker stack is disabled / turned off, then your web browsers will stop working until you restart the Docker host / stack, or remove the proxy setting in your web browsers.

Set up VPN Connection for Entire Docker Stack:

Its a mandatory requirement you have an active VPN connection, otherwise Gluetun will not establish a VPN tunnel, and there will be no data forwarded to the Internet for the entire docker stack.

A full list of supported VPN / Wireguard providers can be found on the Gluetun wiki on the right hand side menu: Home Â· qdm12/gluetun Wiki

Gluetun also supports custom VPN configurations if you have alternate VPN setups, the docker-compose file has the necessary variables if you need to set up a custom VPN connection, including Wireguard.

VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=VPN provider name
VPN_USERNAME=<username from VPN provider>
VPN_PASSWORD=<password from VPN provider>
SERVER_REGION=<regions supported by VPN provider>

Main Folders For Media and Docker Persistent Configurations:

This is the most important component of your media server, were data is going to be stored, and how all the different Docker applications are going to access the different media / configuration files.

When you set up folders / volumes on the host computer, you need to map them in the Docker configuration, so the applications can access the data. The docker-compose file has already set up all the correct folder mappings between the host computer and docker applications by using environment variables in the YAML file, however you will need to update the variables below so the the docker-compose build knows which folders to map.

When considering media storage, you also need to consider files are going to be downloaded by the Docker applications and moved between folders, which are actually being moved by the underlaying host computer. So you need to consider what happens when moving a 10GB file between two folders inside different Docker applications, may in fact be getting transferred to different HDDs / Filesystems / Volumes, on the host system - this can greatly slow down the performance of disk operations and docker performance.

It is highly recommended the locations you choose for the MEDIA, TORRENTS, USENET, and WATCH folders, are located on the same HDD / Volume / Partition on the local host computer. The Docker stack has been carefully planned, and as long as these host folders are using these principles, then the Docker application will take advantage of Atomic Moves (instant) inside the containers.

FOLDER_FOR_DOCKER_DATA= # Folder to store persistent configuration settings for all the docker applications
FOLDER_FOR_MEDIA= # Folder where root of media library exists
FOLDER_FOR_TORRENTS= # Folder where all torrent files will be downloaded (Transmission)
FOLDER_FOR_USENET= # Folder where all NZB Usenet files will be downloaded (NZBGet)
FOLDER_FOR_WATCH= # Folder to place NZB and Torrent files for manual downloading

The following table provides examples on how the folders located on the Host computer, will be mapped to the folders inside the Docker containers.


Environment Variable:â
Synology Example:â
Linux Example:â
Windows Example:â
Docker Path:â
FOLDER_FOR_DOCKER_DATA	/volume1/docker	/opt/docker	D:\Docker	Differs by container
FOLDER_FOR_MEDIA	/volume1/media	/opt/media	D:\Media	/data/media
FOLDER_FOR_TORRENTS	/volume1/data/torrents	/opt/torrents	D:\Torrents	/data/torrents
FOLDER_FOR_USENET	/volume1/data/usenet	/opt/usenet	D:\Usenet	/data/usenet
FOLDER_FOR_WATCH	/volume1/data/watch	/opt/watch	D:\Watch	/data/watch

You need to define your own folders for Synology / Linux / Windows, however the locations you define in the variables, will be mapped to the docker application as per the Docker Path column.

NOTE: It is recommended the folders you use on the host computer, remain empty until completing the entire guide and setting up all the applications. So if you plan to use folder names that current have media, you should rename the old folders, create new ones, then copy the media into the new folders after completing this guide.
